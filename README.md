## üöÄ Quote Validation & Configuration Assistant ‚Äì Feature List

This application simulates an intelligent, chat-forward assistant that validates quotes, identifies missing components, checks compatibility, and suggests alternatives for EOS or unavailable SKUs. The interface is styled using [ShadCN/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) with a clean black-and-white aesthetic and uses modular files and synthetic data.

### üß† Core AI Features

- **Quote Completeness Check**  
  Validates whether a quote includes all necessary components such as power cords, optics, licenses, or cables.

- **End-of-Sale (EOS) SKU Detection**  
  Detects discontinued or unavailable SKUs and suggests modern alternatives with reasoning.

- **Product Compatibility Validation**  
  Confirms whether quoted components are compatible (e.g., AP-to-controller mapping, PoE budgets, port counts).

- **Confidence Scoring**  
  Every AI response includes a visual confidence bar (0-100%) for transparency.

- **Citations & Source Linking**  
  Cited document links are provided with tooltips for user reference and trust.

### üí¨ Conversational Chat Interface

- **Chat-First Interaction Model**  
  Users interact with the system through a natural chat interface, mimicking enterprise agent UX.

- **Streaming Responses**  
  Responses appear in a typed, streaming fashion for realism and user engagement.

- **Multi-Turn Conversations**  
  Maintains context across multiple interactions within a session.

- **Inline Feedback**  
  Users can rate individual answers (üëç/üëé) and leave comments to improve future responses.

- **Download & Copy Tools**  
  Quick actions to copy or download individual answers.

### üìÑ Document Upload & Ingestion

- **Drag-and-Drop Uploading**  
  Users can upload documents in `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.ppt`, `.txt`, `.json`, and `.html` formats.

- **Synthetic Parsing**  
  Files are parsed using mock logic to simulate quote extraction and indexing.

- **Upload as Context**  
  Uploaded files become part of the chat context and influence AI responses.

### üß© Quote Validation Engine (Synthetic Logic)

- **SKU Configuration Ruleset**  
  Simulated rule-based validation for what constitutes a "complete" product bundle.

- **Substitution Suggestions**  
  Logic to propose compatible and current replacements for outdated or unsupported SKUs.

- **Compatibility Matrix**  
  Synthetic model to evaluate component matching, like switch/AP power budgets or port needs.

- **Pluggable AI Agent Endpoint**  
  Easily replace synthetic engine with live Lyzr agent or external API for production use.

### üß™ Prewritten Scenarios (for demo purposes)

- Missing SFP optics or cables
- EOS detection with suggested SKU
- Incompatible AP/controller or AP/PoE switch pairings
- License mismatches
- Multi-component validation queries
